Note to team

Due to the nature of the POS System, scaling may be an issue in the beginning. Different partitions in the program may scale differently depending on screen size, screen resolution or screen orientation.
Also, this program must be coded with fullscreen in mind. When opened on your browser, press F11. This should put your browser in fullscreen mode.
